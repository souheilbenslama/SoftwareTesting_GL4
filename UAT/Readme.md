## User Acceptance Testing 


User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment.


The main Purpose of UAT is to validate end to end business flow. It does not focus on cosmetic errors, spelling mistakes or system testing.

It consists of 8 segments:

* UAT Scope
* UAT Assumptions and Constraints
* UAT Risks
* UAT Team Roles & Responsibilities
* UAT Entry Criteria
* UAT Requirements-Based Test Cases
* UAT Test Results
* Document Signatures
